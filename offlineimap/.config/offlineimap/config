# Mailbox name recorder
##################################################
[mbnames]

# Offlineimap can record your mailbox names in a format you specify.
# You can define the header, each mailbox item, the separator,
# and the footer.  Here is an example for Mutt.
# If enabled is yes, all settings except incremental must be specified, even if
# they are just the empty string "".
#
# The header, peritem, sep, and footer are all Python expressions passed
# through eval, so you can (and must) use Python quoting.
#
# The incremental setting controls whether the file is written after each
# account completes or once all synced accounts are complete. This is useful if
# an account is sightly slower than the other. It allows keeping the previous
# file rather than having it partially written.
# This works best with "no" if in one-shot mode started by cron or systemd
# timers. Default: no.
#
# The following hash key are available to the expansion for 'peritem':
# - accountname: the name of the corresponding account;
# - foldername: the name of the folder;
# - localfolders: path to the local directory hosting all Maildir
#   folders for the account.
#
# Tilde and environment variable expansions will be performed
# for "filename" knob.
#
# enabled = no
